Problem Statement
Managing library inventory and book issuance using manual registers is time-consuming and error-prone. Students face delays if a book’s availability is unclear or records are missing. There is a need for a simple, automated library system that helps track available books, issues, returns, and late fines reliably.

Scope of the Project
This project aims to provide a console-based library management solution for small libraries or educational institutes. It covers core operations like viewing available books, issuing books to students, returning books, and calculating fines for late submissions. The system uses a SQLite database for persistent record-keeping of books and issued transactions.
